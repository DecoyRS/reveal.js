                    My game development experience spans over 7 to 8 years, working in outsourcing company on big AAA titles.
                    It all started with FIFA series, a football simulator made by Electronic Arts company, I was lucky to be working on first FIFA game for the "NEXT GEN" consoles of those years, I'm talking PS4 and XBox One.
                    Then I've switched to World of Warships, free-to-play wargame by Wargaming company, working on all kinds of tools that I'll go in detail later on.
                    After that, Rainbow 6: Siege by Ubisoft, tools and engine side of the project.
                    And my last game project was Injustice 2 Mobile, by NetherRealm, the same folks that's been making Mortal Kombat series.
                    Last one was using Unreal Engine 4 and I hated it so much that I've decided to leave game development industry to work on tools for software developers, specifically targeting Unreal Engine 4.

                    So, few words about tools.
                    I've worked on all kinds of "editors", be it Sound Editor, Particle Editor, World Editor aka Map Editor and so on.
                    Mind you that having that many editors is becoming part of the history. Nowadays, with beefy CPU's and affordable SSD's, loading times of different assets has become negligible.

                    A Tools Engineer is a software engineer that supports the development
                    of the content and code for the development of the game (instead of the game itself).
                    They work to improve the rate-of-change at which the game can be built,
                    to improve the quality of the game, and enhance the user experience of creating the game.

                    Now, I've talked a lot about CS skills, like programming and all kinds of technologies that's good to have in your pocket.
                    But what's being looked over quite often is User Experience. It's not enough to make your tools work.
                    It's equally (and some times even more important) to make them work beautifully and non-intrusively.

                    And what I mean by that. Let's have a look at Maslow Pyramide for Tools.
                    You can create a console utility that takes an image from Photoshop and converts it into texture in your game engine.
                    Is it useful? Absolutely.
                    Is it usable? Barely. For CI pipeline and server-side tasks it's perfect, but what about artists that need to check their work in game real quick?
                    They need to run some funky console tool to export, make sure in the process they haven't messed up parameters for the utility and prey for gods that their work is picked up by the game.
                    Alright. Next step is UI wrapper, with checkboxes and input fields that can check if inputs are correct and users don't need to memorize all the options, they are available at glance.
                    Is it usable? Of course. But is it desirable?
                    Artists spend decades mastering their tools, learning by heart all the key combos for manipulating assets,
                    using tablets instead of mouse to be as productive as possible and now they need to shift their precious attention to some random unknown tool to get it into the game?
                    How can we improve on this process?
                    We cam make a plugin to Photoshop that will add an action to launch a conversion utility on file and will fire up the game with new assets, so artists don't need to do anything outside of their comfort zone.
                    All the info they need are at the flick of a key.
